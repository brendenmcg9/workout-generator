# Features to be implemented in the future

Short term features to be implemented include:

- option for lower or higher intensity

- counter for total number of reps for entire workout (this could also be used to generate a workout with a user setting a desired total rep range)

- Exception handling

Long term features to be implemented:

- Move from console application to web app or mobile app

- Possibly include a sign/up login so users can save past workouts and preferences (after moving to web or mobile app)
